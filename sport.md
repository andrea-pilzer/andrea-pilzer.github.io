I've always loved to do sport. First cross-country and downhill skiing. Then I got into Curling (more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling)) and with some of my friends we made up [Team Trentino](https://it-it.facebook.com/TrentinoCurling/). We have been Italian Men's Champions and part of the Italian National team.

My greatest achievement was to compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang (South Korea). :punch: :muscle:
