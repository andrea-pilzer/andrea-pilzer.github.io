I've always loved to do sport. First cross-country and downhill skiing. Then I got into Curling (more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling)) and with some of my friends we make up [Team Trentino](https://it-it.facebook.com/TrentinoCurling/). We are Italian Men's Champions and part of the Italian National team.

Keep your fingers crossed we still have a chance to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang (South Korea).
