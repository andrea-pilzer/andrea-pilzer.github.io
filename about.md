I'm Andrea Pilzer, postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Science Department of Aalto University in FInland. I grew up in [Cembra Valley](https://www.visitpinecembra.it/en/discover-the-territory/food-and-wine/terraced-vineyards) a very steep and famous wine producing area near Trento, Italy.

Currently I'm focusing on dense regression problems as depth estimation and on the broad problem of domain adaptation for deep learning based models. I work at AaltoVision group with Prof. [Juho Kannala](https://users.aalto.fi/~kannalj1/) and AaltoML group with Prof. [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/). My research interests are in deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing.
