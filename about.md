I'm Andrea Pilzer, PhD student in CS at [DISI](https://www.disi.unitn.it/), University of Trento in Italy. I grew up in Cembra Valley a very steep and famous wine producing area near Trento.

Currently I'm focusing on studying high-level subjective features of images, like virality. I work in the [MHUG](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/) research group under the supervision of Prof. Nicu Sebe and Elisa Ricci. My research interests are in deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing.
