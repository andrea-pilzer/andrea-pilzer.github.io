I got my PhD degree cum laude last week discussing my thesis "Learning Unsupervised Depth Estimation, from Stereo to Monocular Images".
It was a hard journey, especially if you add preparing for the Olympic games of PyeonChang 2018 half way through it.
But if I look at me 3.5 years ago I am very privileged to have learned so much, and still have so much to learn.

Thanks to all the people I worked with, in particular to Paolo for encouraging me to pursue a PhD and my advisors, Nicu and Elisa, it was a pleasure to work with you!
